üß† AI Impact on Career Stability: A Data-Driven Power BI Dashboard
üìå Overview

This Power BI project analyzes the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on career stability, job demand, automation risk, and future job growth across multiple industries.
The goal is to uncover which professions are most resilient and which are at higher risk of automation ‚Äî providing insights to help professionals, students, and policymakers make data-driven career decisions.

üéØ Objective

The main objective of this project is to:

Understand how AI adoption is reshaping the job market.

Identify roles and industries that are growing or declining.

Evaluate career stability based on automation risk and job growth projections.

Present all findings through interactive and visually appealing Power BI dashboards.

üìä Dataset Details

The dataset used in this project is a custom-built survey-style dataset created from multiple reliable data sources and logical estimates.
It includes 50+ job roles across various industries with attributes such as:

Column Name	Description
Job_Title	Name of the role (e.g., Data Scientist, Accountant, etc.)
Industry	Sector or domain of the job
Company_Size	Size of organization (Small, Medium, Large)
AI_Adoption_Level	Extent of AI implementation (Low, Medium, High)
Automation_Risk	Probability that the job will be automated
Job_Growth_Projection	Expected growth/decline rate over the next 5 years
Skills	Key skills required for the role
Average_Salary	Indicative salary range
Experience_Level	Entry-level / Mid-level / Senior
Country	Focused on India-specific roles

üß© Missing fields were logically estimated and verified to maintain data consistency, no duplicates, and no null values.
